# Predicting Customer Purchase Propensity using LightGBM Classifier
In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore a dataset that contains information about customer behavior and their purchasing habits. We will use the LightGBM classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase or not. To handle the issue of imbalanced data, we will use the SMOTE algorithm, and for hyperparameter tuning, we will use BayesSearchCV.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about customer behavior, including demographic information, website usage, and purchase history. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on this information.

## Tools Used
The following tools were used in this project:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- LightGBM
- SMOTE
- BayesSearchCV

## Data Preprocessing
Before training our model, we need to preprocess our data. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and splitting our data into training and testing sets.

## Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE
Our dataset is imbalanced, with only a small percentage of customers making a purchase. To address this, we will use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm to create synthetic samples of the minority class.

## Training the LightGBM Model
We will use the LightGBM classifier to train our model. This is a powerful gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. We will use BayesSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for our model.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. While an accuracy score of 0.99 suggests that the model is performing very well, we will also examine other metrics and a confusion matrix to get a better understanding of the model's performance.

## Conclusion
Predicting customer purchase propensity is a crucial task for businesses, and machine learning can help automate this process. By using the LightGBM classifier and SMOTE algorithm, we can create an accurate model that predicts whether a customer is likely to make a purchase. It's important to look beyond just accuracy and consider other metrics and the context of the problem to fully assess the model's performance.
